## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores 
## a numeric vector and cache's its mean. 

## The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a 
## list containing a function to
##
## set the value of the vector
## get the value of the vector
## set the value of the mean
## get the value of the mean


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)
}


## The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created 
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already 
## been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the 
## computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value 
## of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...){
  m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}
